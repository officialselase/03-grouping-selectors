# 03-grouping-selectors
Project Overview
This project is part of a CSS exercise aimed at practicing class selectors and applying shared and unique styles to HTML elements. It is also an opportunity to practice Git workflows, including creating a repository, committing changes, and pushing them to a remote repository.

The goal of the exercise is to style two buttons (Kudos and No Kudos) using class selectors while adhering to the following requirements:

Both buttons share a font size and font family.
Each button has unique background and text color styling.
Features
HTML Setup: Two buttons with unique class names for individual styling.
CSS Styling: A shared class for common styles and unique classes for individual properties.
Git Practice: more experience with Git commands, including add, commit, and push.
